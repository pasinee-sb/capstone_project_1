         ReddiSenti uses natural language processing and
         machine learning to
         determine whether the overall sentiment expressed in text data from a keyword search on Reddit is positive,
         negative, or neutral. This is achieved through <a class="text-decoration-none text-primary"
            href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</a>, a
         Python library that simplifies common natural language
         processing tasks.
         Sentiment analysis has many applications, such as brand monitoring, market research, and political analysis. By
         analyzing large volumes of text data, businesses and organizations can gain insights into public opinion and
         make
         informed decisions.
